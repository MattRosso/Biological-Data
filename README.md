# Biological-Data project
The goal of this project is to study a single protein domain and create a sequence model in order to provide
a functional characterization of the family. Our domain is from Cyberlindnera mrakii (Yeast) (Williopsis
mrakii) and its Pfam name is Nitronate monooxygenase (Pfam ID: PF03060)
